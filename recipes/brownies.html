    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.
            Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. 
            Spray the parchment paper.</li>

        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>

        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. 
            Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached</li>
            
    </ol>
