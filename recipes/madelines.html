    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt and ever so slightly brown the butter.
            Remove from heat once you see bits of amber brown butter fall to the bottom of the pan.
            Immediately pour into a bowl and let cool.</li>

        <li>Add sugar and eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk together on medium speed until well combined.</li>

        <li>Add flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, cooled butter and milk to the mixer. Mix on low speed until just combined. Add the pumpkin and mix on low until incorporated. Do not over mix.</li>

        <li>Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for 3 hours or overnight.</li>

        <li>When chilled, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>

        <li>Melt 2 TBSP of butter and use a pastry brush to coat the madeleine molds.</li>

        <li>Use a spoon to place about 1 1/2 TBSP of batter into each mold. Do not over fill. Each mold should be filled about 3/4 of the way. Place the pan in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove the pan from the refrigerator and place directly in the oven for 8-10 minutes.</li>

        <li>When the edges of the madeleines begin to brown and the bump is fully formed, remove the pan from the oven. Immediately remove the cookies from the pan by sliding them out onto a cooling rack.</li>

        <li>Allow to cool completely before glazing with bourbon simple syrup.</li>
  
    </ol>
    <p>For Bourbon Glaze</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sugar and water to a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring often until sugar dissolves completely. Remove from heat and add the bourbon, stirring to combine. Brush the bourbon simple syrup on to the cooled madeleines.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>For Chocolate</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt chopped chocolate in a small bowl over a double boiler until smooth and shiny. Alternatively, melt in a microwave safe bowl in 30 second increments. Stir between each cycle until fully melted and smooth.</li>
    </ol>
